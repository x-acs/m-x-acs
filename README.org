** Installation
#+begin_quote
Note: as GNU Emacs has a lot of features and packages, this repo will be constantly updated, so periodically check it and, if it was updated, repeat the installation steps.

To install ACS on GNU Emacs, follow these instructions:

1. Check what is the default custom theme directory. To do this, press ~M-x~, then type ~customize-variable~ and press enter. After that, type ~custom-theme-directory~ and press enter again.

2. In the "Customize Option" buffer, look for the "String" value (by default, it should be ~​~/.emacs.d/~, but don't worry if it's different). So, from now, the checked path will be mentioned as ~<themes_path>~, so make sure that you've annotated your GNU Emacs ~<themes_path>~!

3. Open a terminal, clone this repo and then and copy the dark and light theme source code files to the ~<themes_path>~ as follow:
   #+begin_src sh
   git clone https://git.disroot.org/x-acs/m-x-acs.git

   cp -f m-x-acs/src/* <themes_path> # "~/.emacs.d/", for example
   #+end_src

4. Open your GNU Emacs configuration file (~​~/.emacs~, or ~​~/.emacs.d/init.el~, or etc.), then choose one of the following ways to auto-load the theme of your choice:

   - ~custom-set-variables~ way (easiest):
     In the ~custom-set-variables~ function of your GNU Emacs configuration file, add the ~custom-enabled-themes~ variable and set it to the theme of your choice, like this:
     #+begin_src elisp
     (custom-set-variables
      ... ; Some Elisp code...
      '(custom-enabled-themes '(x-acs-dark))) ; For the dark theme
     #+end_src

     or

     #+begin_src elisp
     (custom-set-variables
      ... ; Some Elisp code...
      '(custom-enabled-themes '(x-acs-light))) ; For the light theme
     #+end_src

   - ~load-theme~ way *(recomended)*:
     Add the ~load-theme~ function in your GNU Emacs configuration file and set the theme of your choice, like this:
     #+begin_src elisp
     ... ; Some Elisp code...
     (load-theme 'x-acs-dark) ; For the dark theme
     #+end_src

     or

     #+begin_src elisp
     ... ; Some Elisp code...
     (load-theme 'x-acs-light) ; For the light theme
     #+end_src

   Now save and close the configuration file and your GNU Emacs.

5. Reopen your GNU Emacs and, as it's the first theme load, it'll ask
   #+begin_src text
   Loading a theme can run Lisp code.  Really load? (y or n) 
   #+end_src

   press ~y~

   #+begin_src text
   Treat this theme as safe in future sessions? (y or n) 
   #+end_src

   and press ~y~ again.

Now it's done!
