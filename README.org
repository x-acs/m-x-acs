** Installation
To install ACS on GNU Emacs, follow these instructions:

1. Check what is the default custom theme directory. To do this, press ~M-x~, then type ~customize-variable~ and press enter. After that, type ~custom-theme-directory~ and press enter again.

2. In the "Customize Option" buffer, look for the "String" value (by default, it should be ~​~/.emacs.d/~, but don't worry if it's different). So, from now, the checked path will be mentioned as ~<themes_path>~, so make sure that you've annotated your GNU Emacs ~<themes_path>~!

3. Open a terminal, clone this repo and then and copy the dark and light theme source code files to the ~<themes_path>~ as follow:
   #+begin_src sh
   git clone https://git.disroot.org/x-acs/m-x-acs.git

   cp -f m-x-acs/src/* <themes_path> # "~/.emacs.d/", for example
   #+end_src

4. Open your GNU Emacs configuration file (~​~/.emacs~, or ~​~/.emacs.d/init.el~, or etc.), then choose one of the following ways to auto-load the theme of your choice:

   - ~custom-set-variables~ way (easiest):
     In the ~custom-set-variables~ function of your GNU Emacs configuration file, add the ~custom-enabled-themes~ variable and set it to the theme of your choice, like this:
     #+begin_src elisp
     (custom-set-variables
      ... ; Some Elisp code...
      '(custom-enabled-themes '(x-acs-dark))) ; For the dark theme
     #+end_src

     or

     #+begin_src elisp
     (custom-set-variables
      ... ; Some Elisp code...
      '(custom-enabled-themes '(x-acs-light))) ; For the light theme
     #+end_src

   - ~load-theme~ way *(recomended)*:
     Add the ~load-theme~ function in your GNU Emacs configuration file and set the theme of your choice, like this:
     #+begin_src elisp
     ... ; Some Elisp code...
     (load-theme 'x-acs-dark) ; For the dark theme
     #+end_src

     or

     #+begin_src elisp
     ... ; Some Elisp code...
     (load-theme 'x-acs-light) ; For the light theme
     #+end_src

   Now save and close the configuration file and your GNU Emacs.

5. Reopen your GNU Emacs and, as it's the first theme load, it'll ask
   #+begin_src text
   Loading a theme can run Lisp code.  Really load? (y or n) 
   #+end_src

   press ~y~

   #+begin_src text
   Treat this theme as safe in future sessions? (y or n) 
   #+end_src

   and press ~y~ again.

Now it's done!

#+begin_quote
Note: as GNU Emacs has a lot of features and packages, this repo will be constantly updated, so periodically check it and, if it was updated, repeat the installation steps.
