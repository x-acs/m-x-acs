** Installation
#+begin_quote
Note: as GNU Emacs has a lot of features and packages, this repo will be
constantly updated, so periodically check it and, if it was updated, repeat the
installation steps.
#+end_quote

To install ACS on GNU Emacs, follow these steps:

1. Check what is the custom theme directory.

   To do this, type ~M-x customize-variable RET custom-theme-directory RET~.

2. In the "Customize Option" buffer, look for the "String" value. For the next
   steps, we'll assume it is the default value (~​~/.emacs.d/~), but, if yours is
   different, *don't forget to change it in the next steps*!

3. Open a terminal, clone this repo and then and copy the theme files to the
   ~custom-theme-directory~ path (remember to change ~​~/.emacs.d/~ to the
   correct value if yours is different!).

   To do this, run

   #+begin_src sh
git clone https://git.disroot.org/x-acs/m-x-acs.git

cp -f m-x-acs/src/* "~/.emacs.d/"
   #+end_src

4. If you would like to test if a theme can be loaded, simply type
   ~M-x load-theme RET x-acs-dark RET~.

   As that's the first time loading the theme, GNU Emacs might ask if you really
   want to load the theme. If that's the case, just press ~y~ for each question,
   like this:

   #+begin_src text
Loading a theme can run Lisp code.  Really load? (y or n) y

Treat this theme as safe in future sessions? (y or n) y
   #+end_src

   If everything goes fine, then you can disable the theme by typing
   ~M-x disable-theme RET x-acs-dark RET~.

   #+begin_quote
Note: in this example, we selected the regular dark theme (i.e. ~x-acs-dark~),
but you can use any available one. This applies to the next step, so *don't
forget* to change the following code snippets accordingly!
   #+end_quote

5. Choose one of the methods below to auto-load the theme of your choice. Once
   you're done, save your changes.
   - ~load-theme~ method
     If your GNU Emacs is [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html][customized via an init file]] (e.g. ~init.el~), this
     method is more appropriate.

     To do it, open your init file and simply add the ~load-theme~ function
     passing the theme of your choice as the argument, like this:

     #+begin_src elisp
... ; Some Elisp code...
(load-theme 'x-acs-dark)
... ; More Elisp code...
     #+end_src

   - ~custom-set-variables~ method
     If your GNU Emacs is [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Easy-Customization.html][customized via the ~customize~ interface]], this method
     is more appropriate.

     To do it, open your custom file and, in the ~custom-set-variables~
     function, add the ~custom-enabled-themes~ variable setting it to the theme
     of your choice, like this:

     #+begin_src elisp
(custom-set-variables
... ; Some Elisp code...
'(custom-enabled-themes '(x-acs-dark)))
     #+end_src

6. Close and reopen your GNU Emacs. If everything goes fine, the theme should be
   loaded with no errors.

Now it's done!
